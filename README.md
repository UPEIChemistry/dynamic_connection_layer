# Dynamic Connection Layer (DCL)
## Enhancing Molecular Topology Representation in Chemical Graph Neural Networks
The Dynamic Connection Layer (DCL) is an innovative component for chemical graph neural networks, designed to refine molecular topology representations. It employs a dynamic adjustment mechanism, enhancing the accuracy of input topological information, such as chemical bonds or atomic distances, while maintaining general applicability across diverse chemical datasets.

### Key Features
Dynamic Topology Refinement: Combines atomic features and Gaussian sampling to correct or supplement input molecular topology.
Multi-Head Attention Mechanism: Enhances modeling of complex atomic interactions by operating across independent subspaces.
General Applicability: Functions as a trainable layer compatible with various chemical graph datasets.

### Introduction
Chemical graph representations, typically limited to chemical bonds or atomic distances, often fail to capture the full complexity of molecular topology. The DCL layer addresses these limitations by dynamically refining the input topology through learnable mechanisms, enhancing performance in tasks such as chemical bond prediction and molecular property estimation.
